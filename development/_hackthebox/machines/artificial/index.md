# CTF HackTheBox


## About

**Artificial** Artificial is an easy Linux-based machine available on the Hack The Box platform, designed as a great starting point for those new to penetration testing in a controlled and legal environment. This write-up details my full process of compromising the machine, from the initial foothold to achieving full root access.

The goal of this post is twofold: first, to clearly explain each technical step I took — including enumeration, vulnerability exploitation, and privilege escalation — and second, to share the tools, techniques, and thought processes behind each action. Every stage is accompanied by strategic reasoning to illustrate not only how the steps were executed but also why certain approaches were chosen.
