I’m **ProxyGeek**, a cybersecurity enthusiast and ethical hacker with a deep interest in offensive security, digital forensics, and capture-the-flag competitions.

By day, I work on secure development and exploit analysis. By night, I explore reverse engineering, vulnerability research, and write-ups to share what I learn with the community.

- **Cybersecurity Enginer Security & CTF Player**
- Interests: Web exploitation, privilege escalation, binary exploitation, threat modeling
- Frequent player on **Hack The Box**, **RootMe**, **TryHackMe**  and local CTFs
- Background in Computer Science & Security Engineering
- Strong belief in knowledge sharing & open-source collaboration
- GitHub: [@ProxyGeek](https://github.com/Pr0xyG33k)
