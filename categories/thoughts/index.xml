Known for its thrilling Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges, hands-on workshops, and the opportunity to meet some of the brightest minds in cybersecurity, I knew it would be a day to remember. From the moment I registered, I couldn’t wait to dive into the challenges that awaited me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upon arriving, the buzz was palpable. People from all walks of cybersecurity—ethical hackers, penetration testers, and curious enthusiasts—gathered under one roof to push the limits of what we could learn and achieve. The event had a relaxed yet competitive vibe, and I was immediately pulled into the spirit of the community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The workshops were a perfect mix of theory and practice. One of the most interesting sessions was dedicated to &lt;strong&gt;IoT vulnerabilities&lt;/strong&gt;. We learned how easily common devices could be exploited if not properly secured. It was fascinating to see the instructor demonstrate in real time how an insecure device could be hacked—something I had only read about until then. The hands-on nature of these sessions made it feel less like a lecture and more like an immersion into real-world hacking.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Github Workflow</title><link>https://Pr0xyG33k.github.io/posts/github/</link><pubDate>Mon, 12 May 2025 18:26:49 +0200</pubDate><author>1024@Pr0xyG33k.github.io (ProxyGeek)</author><guid>https://Pr0xyG33k.github.io/posts/github/</guid><category domain="https://Pr0xyG33k.github.io/categories/thoughts/">Thoughts</category><description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Behind every well-organized repo lies a story of purpose, experimentation, and constant iteration.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;After years of hands-on experience in cybersecurity and development, I’ve learned that code is just one part of the battle. The &lt;strong&gt;structure&lt;/strong&gt; we build around our work — our process, our repository, our mindset — is what allows our projects to scale, evolve, and remain resilient.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Hello World</title><link>https://Pr0xyG33k.github.io/posts/hello-world/</link><pubDate>Sat, 10 May 2025 02:47:00 +0200</pubDate><author>1024@Pr0xyG33k.github.io (ProxyGeek)</author><guid>https://Pr0xyG33k.github.io/posts/hello-world/</guid><category domain="https://Pr0xyG33k.github.io/categories/thoughts/">Thoughts</category><description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;What wakes you up every morning is not the alarm clock, but your dreams.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve lived through moments where this belief kept me going. I’ve seen the effort I’ve put into my work, and now, as I look back, the real question isn’t whether I’ve earned what I have — it’s about continuing to push forward, unflinching in the face of challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In cybersecurity, the fight is never over. It’s a world where the enemy never sleeps, and neither should we.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From my early days in tech, grappling with complex algorithms and shifting to cybersecurity, the road has been long. I started with basic coding, moved to penetration testing, then switched to defensive security, teaching interns, and tackling real-world security problems. Every step has been driven by &lt;strong&gt;curiosity&lt;/strong&gt; and the desire to &lt;strong&gt;defend&lt;/strong&gt; what matters — our digital lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time doesn’t pause because we hesitate. Like you, there are countless others chasing their dreams. No one is born a cybersecurity expert, but each day is an opportunity to grow, to protect, and to evolve. Never be content with where you are; always strive to learn, to adapt, and to secure.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
