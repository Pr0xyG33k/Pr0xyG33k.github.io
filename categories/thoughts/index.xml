&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;What wakes you up every morning is not the alarm clock, but your dreams.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>I’ve lived through moments where this belief kept me going. I’ve seen the effort I’ve put into my work, and now, as I look back, the real question isn’t whether I’ve earned what I have — it’s about continuing to push forward, unflinching in the face of challenges.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In cybersecurity, the fight is never over. It’s a world where the enemy never sleeps, and neither should we.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>From my early days in tech, grappling with complex algorithms and shifting to cybersecurity, the road has been long. I started with basic coding, moved to penetration testing, then switched to defensive security, teaching interns, and tackling real-world security problems. Every step has been driven by &lt;strong>curiosity&lt;/strong> and the desire to &lt;strong>defend&lt;/strong> what matters — our digital lives.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Time doesn’t pause because we hesitate. Like you, there are countless others chasing their dreams.

Never be content with where you are; always strive to learn, to adapt, and to secure.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
